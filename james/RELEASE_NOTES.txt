Release Notes - Apache JAMES Server
===================================
The Apache James Server is a 100% pure Java SMTP and POP3 Mail server 
and NNTP News server designed to be a complete and portable enterprise 
mail engine solution. James is based on currently available open protocols.

The James server also serves as a mail application platform. The James 
project hosts the Apache Mailet API, and the James server is a Mailet 
container. This feature makes it easy to design, write, and deploy custom 
applications for mail processing. This modularity and ease of customization 
is one of James' strengths, and can allow administrators to produce powerful 
applications surprisingly easily. 

Version 2.3.2
=============
Is a point release which is (almost) compatible with 2.3.1.

Known Incompatibility
-----------------------
The management of the MessageID header has been altered to improve
compliance with the specification. Previously, the MessageID was 
frequently altered by mailets. Now, MessageIDs must be explicitly
updated. In particular, when cloning a MimeMessage to create a new,
different message the MessageID must be programmatically updated. 

Notes
-----
  * The Mordred data source is deprecated and will be removed in a future 
    minor release.
  * The cryptography mailets and matchers are now available as a separate 
    library (http://james.apache.org/mailet/crypto/). The versions included
    will be replaced by this library in a future minor release. Users
    should upgrade to the library versions.
